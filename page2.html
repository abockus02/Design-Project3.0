        <p class="p1">To start up your dungeons and dragons adventures you will first want to find a group<br> that you will be able to play with. It may be a group of friends or some people you<br> meet online. Next you'll want to brush up on the rules by reading the dungeons and <br> dragons players handbook (this can be found on website in "Supplies") and then create<br> a character. After that you're all set to start playing with your new group.<br> If you can fill out all the question on this form confidently then you should be ready<br> to play without issues.<p>
