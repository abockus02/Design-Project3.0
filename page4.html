        <p class="p1">D&D is a fantasy tabletop role-playing game originally created and designed by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson.<br> The game was first published in 1974 by Tactical Studies Rules, Inc. It has been published by Wizards of <br> the Coast, now a subsidiary of Hasbro, since 1997. The game was derived from miniature wargames, with <br> a variation of the 1971 game Chainmail serving as the initial rule system. D&D's publication is commonly <br> recognized as the beginning of modern role-playing games and the role-playing game industry, and also <br> deeply influenced video games, especially the role-playing video game genre.D&D departs from traditional <br> wargaming by allowing each player to create their own character to play instead of a military formation. <br> These characters embark upon adventures within a fantasy setting. A Dungeon Master (DM) serves as <br> referee and storyteller for the game, while maintaining the setting in which the adventures occur, and playing <br> the role of the inhabitants of the game world, known as non-player characters (NPCs). The characters form a <br> party and they interact with the setting's inhabitants and each other. Together they solve problems, engage in <br> battles, explore, and gather treasure and knowledge. In the process, player characters earn experience points <br> (XP) to level up, and become increasingly powerful over a series of separate gaming sessions. Players choose <br> a class when they create their character, which gives them special perks and abilities every few levels. </p>
